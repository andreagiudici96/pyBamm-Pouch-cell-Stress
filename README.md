# pyBamm-Pouch-cell-Stress


Code that predicts stress distribution in the electrodes of a battery in operation

pouch_cell_stress_good.ipynb is an example of how you can use PyBaMM to simulate the stress of a battery

biham_solver_good_pubamm_final.ipynb is an example of how you can find the shear and in plan streesses in the current collector using a biharmonic finite element solver
